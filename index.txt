9:T545,I am an undergraduate student majoring in **Theoretical and Applied Mechanics** at the College of Engineering, **Peking University**. I am currently advised by [Prof. Sheng Mao](https://mech.pku.edu.cn/jzyg/szdw/M/1556060709314313b42004664ee0bd5a.htm). I also had the privilege of conducting summer research under the supervision of [Prof. Yang Jiao](https://sites.google.com/view/complexmateriallab/people) at **Arizona State University**.

I view mathematics, physics, and computation not as isolated disciplines, but as reflections of nature at different levels, unified by a deep, intrinsic beauty. My academic journey is dedicated to grasping this unity to advance our understanding of the material world.

At the intersection of **computational mechanics**, **applied mathematics**, and **materials science**, I am currently developing frameworks to decode the behavior of **heterogeneous materials**. My work navigates through **hyperuniformity** and **microstructure modeling**, utilizing **homogenization theory** and **stochastic analysis** to bridge scales. By solving **partial differential equations** through rigorous **numerical analysis**, I aim to translate these theoretical mathematical principles into tangible technological advancements.

*I am open to discussions and potential collaborations that explore these intersections.*b:T556,@article{jbx2-h1x5,

  abstract = {We derive a contrast expansion formalism for the effective conductivity of heterogeneous materials (media) with local properties described by arbitrary continuous random fields, significantly generalizing the widely used two-phase (binary-field) models. The theory produces a rapidly convergent Neumann series that, upon Gaussian closure via a Hermite expansion, yields closed-form first-, second-, and third-order approximations, which achieve percent-level accuracy at first order for isotropic media. For anisotropic media, second-order approximations achieve sub-2% accuracy across a wide range of local property contrasts and correlations. Our formalism provides mathematically rigorous structure-property closures, with significant implications for the discovery and design of graded and architected materials with tailored transport properties.}
}c:T4c1,Hyperuniform continuous random fields suppress large‐scale fluctuations while preserving rich local disorder, making them highly attractive for next‐generation photonic, thermal, and mechanical materials. However, traditional construction techniques rendering digital realizations of the random fields often suffer from limited spectral control or excessive computational cost, especially in high‐resolution two- and three-dimensional settings. In this work we present a generative algorithm based on generalized superellipse spectral filtering, which allows independent tuning of isotropic and anisotropic spectral envelopes without resorting to costly iterative schemes. We demonstrate our method on a comprehensive set of two- and three-dimensional examples, showing precise manipulation of spectral band shape and speedup of orders of magnitude compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we examine simple sign thresholding of the continuous fields and report the resulting ±1 two-phase maps, which inherit shell-shaped spectral motifs while generally not preserving exact hyperuniformity. This work opens new avenues for large‐scale simulation and optimized design of advanced hyperuniform materials.d:T6bc,@article{6lz1-7nt6,

}e:T92e,Disordered hyperuniform (DHU) materials are an emerging class of exotic heterogeneous material systems characterized by a unique combination of disordered local structures and a hidden long-range order, which endow them with unusual physical properties, including large isotropic photonic band gaps, superior resistance to fracture, and nearly optimal electrical and thermal transport properties, to name but a few. Here, we consider material systems possessing continuously varying local material properties K(x) (e.g., thermal or electrical conductivity), modeled via a random field. We devise quantitative microstructure representation of the material systems based on a class of analytical spectral density function χ̃K(k) associated with K(x), possessing a power-law small-k scaling behavior χ̃K(k)∼kα. By controlling the exponent α and using a highly efficient forward generative model, we obtain realizations of a wide spectrum of distinct material microstructures spanning from hyperuniform (α>0) to nonhyperuniform (α=0) to antihyperuniform (α<0) systems. Moreover, we perform a comprehensive perturbation analysis to quantitatively connect the fluctuations of the local material property to the fluctuations of the resulting physical fields. In the weak-contrast limit, i.e., when the fluctuations of the property are much smaller than the average value, our first-order perturbation theory reveals that the physical fields associated with Class-I hyperuniform materials (characterized by α≥2) are also hyperuniform, albeit with a lower hyperuniformity exponent (α−2). As one moves away from this weak-contrast limit, the fluctuations of the physical field develop a diverging spectral density at the origin, revealed by our higher-order analysis. We also establish an end-to-end mapping connecting the spectral density of the local material property to the overall effective conductivity of the material system via numerical homogenization. We show that the strong stealthy-like hyperuniform systems can achieve nearly optimal effective conductivity and observe a sharp decrease of the variance of effective properties across realizations as α increases from antihyperuniform values to hyperuniform values. Our results have significant implications for the design of novel DHU materials with targeted physical properties.f:Tb14,@article{ZHONG2025121218,
